        <h2>Brief Summary </h2>
    <!-- paragraph section -->
   
        <p>
        Renaissance art, painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and literature produced during the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries in 
        Europe under the combined influences of an increased awareness of nature, a revival of classical learning, and a more individualistic view of man. 
        Scholars no longer believe that the Renaissance marked an abrupt break with medieval values, as is suggested by the French word renaissance, 
        literally “rebirth.” Rather, historical sources suggest that interest in nature, humanistic learning, and individualism were already 
        present in the late medieval period and became dominant in 15th- and 16th-century Italy concurrently with social and economic changes 
        such as the secularization of daily life, the rise of a rational money-credit economy, and greatly increased social mobility.

        <h2>The Last Supper (1495)</h2>
    <!-- paragraph section -->
    <p>
            According to Christian teachings, the Last Supper was the final meal that Jesus shared with his disciples. The story is a pivotal 
            one in the New Testament, and Christians view the Last Supper as the basis for their rite of Holy Communion. With such significance 
            to Christians, it makes sense then that the Last Supper has been rendered time and again, through an array of media, over the course of 
            Western art history. While the scene has been a common one for artists to depict, the specific uses for depictions of the Last Supper 
            have varied.For example, Adriaen van Wesel’s The Last Supper (Het Laatste Avondmaal) would have been used to explain the particulars of 
            the Last Supper as an event. Meanwhile, illuminations such as those by Ulrich Taler were more focused on the rite of Holy Communion itself.

        <h2>School of Athens (1508)</h2>
    <!-- paragraph section -->
        <p>
        Raphael's greatest work, School of Athens was painted in the Vatican at the same time that Michelangelo was working on the Sistine Chapel. 
        In this large fresco Raphael brings together representatives of the Aristotelian and Platonic schools of thought. Instead of the densely 
        packed, turbulent surface of Michelangelo's masterpiece, Raphael places his groups of calmly conversing philosophers and artists in a 
        vast court with vaults receding into the distance. Raphael was initially influenced by Leonardo, and he incorporated the pyramidal composition 
        and beautifully modelled faces of The Virgin of the Rocks into many of his own paintings of the Madonna. He differed from Leonardo, however, in 
        his prodigious output, his even temperament, and his preference for classical harmony and clarity.

        <h2>God’s Creation (1511)</h2>
    <!-- paragraph section -->
        <p>
            Michelangelo was inspired by the Genesis phrase "God created man in his own image" by drawing two similar bodies, both strong and robust. 
            On the left side is Adam lying on the ground, and seems to be waking up, while God on the right side comes from Heaven surrounded by angels.
            The look of the Creator, represented with a long beard and gray hair, is determined while the look of Adam represented with a strong young man, 
            seems to be one of naive amazement.Just below Adam is one of the Ignudi, while the background of the scene does not contain much details and the 
            light background further highlights the characters and the scene turns into a clear iconic message. The main detail of the fresco is surely represented 
            by the fingers of God and Adam touching each other. The Creator’s index finger pointed authoritatively at the man seems to be ready to give an impulse to Adam's hand, 
            which instead seems as weak as if it were ready to receive energy from the Lord.
            Michelangelo decided to represent the divine breath of life with God’s and Adam’s fingers almost touching each other. 
            This famous gesture represents the creation of the first man with the Creator’s index finger ready to strike a spark upon 
            contact with Adam’s hand.
